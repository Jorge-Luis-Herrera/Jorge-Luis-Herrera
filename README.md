# Hi :) I will take 5 minutes from your time

## I'm Jorge, a Computer Science student at the University of Havana, Cuba (of course, living here).

### I'm currently working as a freelancer and leading small tech startups in *Cuba* and *Peru*.

### My two passions are *-creating-* tech projects and *-learning-* new programming science skills by reading books and leadership stories.

### In my free time (not too much, sadly), I solve competitive programming problems and play some games.

### You can find me doing these at:
[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/Detroy) | [Discord](https://discord.com/users/763983000357961750)

*I'm a little slow to respond to messages, but I always do it ;).*

### **This is some of my mindset performance:**

- **"If you can imagine it, you can program it."** People burn with the skill to do the impossible thoughts of their minds; society changes them by fear.
- No matter the cost, the hard way is the only form to change the result. Doing it alone has a limit. **"We all are humans, after all."** Find your limits, and then talk to others who already know their limits and break them together.
- **"Keep the body to calm the mind."** The only way to make a difference without going crazy is absolutely taking rest well and calming down. The best way to do it is, absolutely, destroying your body.
- **"Memento Mori."** We all are going to leave this world. Your legacy is your pixels; memories are the only thing you have in your last moments. Don't forget you are part of "Humanity." Science is a process, the part of your life you leave, with tired eyes and happy from your results.
